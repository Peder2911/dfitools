"I, as a teenager really enjoyed this movie!"
"Mary Kate\n\n and Ashley worked great together and everyone seemed so at ease."
"I thought the movie plot was very good and hope everyone else enjoys it to!"
"Be sure and rent it!!"
"Also they had\n\n some great soccer scenes for all those soccer players!"
":)"
"For those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls, think again."
"There is a totally different side to the Japanese animation."
"Yakitate!"
"Japan is one of those shows."
"It is a sweet-natured tale of a young boy with the gift to make delicious bread."
"His universe is \nall about creating a Japanese bread that can match with the famous European breads."
"The show is as wacky as they come and I'm sure that non-Japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes."
"But it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show."
"<br /><br />In the world of Yakitate!"
"it is not uncommon for people to look like they've just had an orgasm after eating bread."
"The bread is 
hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide array of super powers, from time-traveling to swimming like a fish."
"That weird aspect makes it into one of the least predictable and funny shows I've watched in a while."
"I have seen Dirty Work several times and is probably my favourite Stan and Ollie short.<br /><br />In this one, Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and get the job to clean the chimney at the home of Professor Noodle (Lucien Littlefield)."
"While 
Noodle is doing mad experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause much chaos trying to clean the chimney and make a mess of the living room."
"The end is where Ollie falls into a tank of special formula that Noodle uses for his experiments and this turns him into a chimp!"
"The best part is where Ollie falls down the chimney and loads of bricks land on his head, but he doesn't seem to suffer much pain from this.<br /><br />Dirty Work is Stan and Ollie at their funniest."
"Great fun.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars out of 5."
"Someday somebody is going to write an essay comparing Paul Naschy's ""Fury of the Wolfman"" to the great Spanish surrealist films, ""L'age D'or"" and ""Un Chien Andelou""."
"The Naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end."
"Dali and Bunuel probably loved it, and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull off.<br /><br />The film lacks cohesive structure even though it does have a plot that moves from A to B to C. Some mishmash about a ""Professor Walterman"" -- his first name, mind you -- who was bitten by a Yeti monster during an expedition to Tibet and hasn't been the same since, which is understandable."
"One of his jealous colleagues, the insane daughter of the noted Doctor Wolfstein, knows about his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him."
"But its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beast.<br /><br />""Walterman"" flips out, turns into a werewolf, kills a few people, is electrocuted, dies, is buried, unburied, taken to a castle filled with circus freaks, wired to various machines, zapped with assorted electronic effects, injected with potent elixirs, is chained up, turns into a werewolf, a woman in an evening gown with thigh-high Nazi fetish boots whips him, he escapes, helps the pretty female doctor find her way out of the castle, fends off the circus freaks with a battle axe, eventually turns back into a werewolf, and has to fight to the death against the female werewolf incarnation of his cheating wife."
"The lady with the Nazi boots shoots him with silver bullets from her Luger pistol, they die together, and the pretty doctor walks off into the morning with the studly reporter, who did nothing."
"""Look!"
"What a beautiful day it is!"""
"<br /><br />""La furia del Hombre Lobo"" was written by Paul Naschy in a hurry."
"Original director Enrique Eguilez was fired and replaced by Jos Mara Zabalza, a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production."
"He was often unable to work (though he did find time to instruct his 14 year old nephew to make some alterations to the script) and Naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited."
"Zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of Naschy's previous movies, ""Mark of the Wolfman""."
"The scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different, and helped pad out the runtime after Zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie."
"Post production was a nightmare."
"Nobody knew who was doing the editing, the money ran out, the master print disappeared for a while, and then at a pre-release screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find Zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater."
"He was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curb.<br /><br />Yet somehow the film works, if you let it."
"It keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles, vaulted catacombs, chains, whips, gloomy moors."
"Fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesn't make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution."
"In one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning; in the next shot its bone dry and he's howling at the full moon."
"Then its raining again."
"And yet you don't look at it as a gaffe."
"Its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible, opposites are the same, and effects proceed causes; First the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams, and then the cable starts sparking with electricity."
"People say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness -- I say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend."
"It is a marvel of making something out of nothing, and succeeds not because of what it could of had, but because of what it does."
"It's easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it."
"The trick is being able to see through the mayhem, or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effect.<br /><br />Paul Naschy died last week at the age of 75."
"He had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more, was working on film projects right up until his last days, but passed away in Madrid, Spain, with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment."
"His rich, varied, and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disinterest."
"And yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like ""Fury of the Wolfman"" in rapt awe."
"Even people who don't like Euro Horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at, if only for just a minute in a couple spots."
"You can find it for free at Archive.Org or even buy it on a DVD for a nickel."
"It's worth far, far more.<br /><br />Amusingly, Naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted, sick, demented little movie as a classic, if not an outright masterpiece of Cinema Dementia."
"The problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for Naschy to forgive."
"I would never presume to dare to forgive it for him, but I will say this: I'd rather watch ""Fury of the Wolfman"" in its dingiest, most cut and degraded fullscreen public domain print than ever sit though the overbearing, obnoxious crap churning out up at the Swine Flu cineplexes this or any other weekend.<br /><br />The world lost a great artist this month."
"Watch his films, and remember.<br /><br />9/10"
"Carlos Mencia was excellent this is hour special."
"He was working hard to show everybody he was the real deal."
"I know people have said he's stolen material in this special, but that is not true."
"Carlos brings comedy up front the way he wants it, not how anyone else wants it, that is why he is so good."
"People say he's not funny because he says Dee dee dee too much, and they still haven't realized thats part of his act, and they don't want it that way, but he brings it like that anyway, and succeeds in making people laugh."
"For all the haters out there, here is a message, Carlos is here to stay, you have no point in trying to bring him down."
"I recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her."
"The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen.<br /><br />After the original film, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other."
"Jane's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically, but also quite sexually in love.<br /><br />One's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually."
"And Jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality.<br /><br />The skin show in this film is off the charts."
"In addition to Jane's two-piece sexy midriff, leg, and hip baring costume, she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan."
"(although it is not O'Sullivan, but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene) Weissmuller, also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth."
"The ladies will delight when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips.<br /><br />It's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry."
"Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie."
"""The Invisible Mouse"" is a delightful and different Tom & Jerry's cartoon."
"It features the usual cat/mouse chases and battles, but in a different way this time."
"Jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of ""surprises"" for Tom, scare him, torment him and confuse him.<br /><br />As much as it is weird, it's also very cool and funny to see what we can't see: Jerry invisible."
"It's amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who's doing it (we know who, right?)"
"- it's like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts."
"It's equally amusing to see Jerry eating some candies and fruits while he's invisible."
"I really like that instrumental music which plays when he's not visible.<br /><br />Some of the best jokes on this short are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and slams him and even when Tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and Jerry writes ""Missed me""."
"I also like when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face.<br /><br />Overall, this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some nice artwork too."
"John Candy's Performance in Once Upon A Crime is possibly his best ever."
"It's been My Favourite Movie since it came out."
"I Spent 5 Years searching for it."
"That's How Good It Is."
"If You Disagree, well, that's your opinion."
"Enjoy The Movie."
"Here Italy (I write from Venice)."
"Why cancelated?"
"The ABC should have given it a chance to build an audience."
"The cast (w/Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've seen in recent."
"We need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless drones."
"I hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up."

"If you're one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as 'Book of the Dead', 'Book of Eibon' or 'Necronomicon', then you should feel right at home with Malefique, a film which also features an occult tome, one with the power to change the destinies of all involved."
"Discovered by four French prisoners sharing a cell, the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by Danvers, a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s; a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished."
"Finders of the book are Carrre (Grald Laroche) a company embezzler shopped by his wife, Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body-builds to execute an escape plan, the halfwit Pquerette (Dimitri Rataud) who once ate his baby sister, and the 'librarian' Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), supposedly driven mad by reading, who murdered his wife."
"Reminding the viewer of Meat Loaf's equally bizarre, bosomy male in Fight Club (1999), Lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet, one who is especially protective of the infantile Pquerette."
"With the coming of the book however, and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents, Marcus assumes greater and greater significance."
"At first assured of an early bail, meanwhile Carrre takes little more than academic interest in events."
