"I, as a teenager really enjoyed this movie!"
"Mary Kate and Ashley worked great together and everyone seemed so at ease."
"I thought the movie plot was very good and hope everyone else enjoys it to!"
"Be sure and rent it!!"
"Also they had some great soccer scenes for all those soccer players!"
":)"
"For those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls, think again."
"There is a totally different side to the Japanese animation."
"Yakitate!"
"Japan is one of those shows."
"It is a sweet-natured tale of a young boy with the gift to make delicious bread."
"His universe is all about creating a Japanese bread that can match with the famous European breads."
"The show is as wacky as they come and I'm sure that non-Japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes."
"But it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show."
"<br /><br />In the world of Yakitate!"
"it is not uncommon for people to look like they've just had an orgasm after eating bread."
"The bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide array of super powers, from time-traveling to swimming like a fish."
"That weird aspect makes it into one of the least predictable and funny shows I've watched in a while."
"I have seen Dirty Work several times and is probably my favourite Stan and Ollie short.<br /><br />In this one, Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and get the job to clean the chimney at the home of Professor Noodle (Lucien Littlefield)."
"While Noodle is doing mad experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause much chaos trying to clean the chimney and make a mess of the living room."
"The end is where Ollie falls into a tank of special formula that Noodle uses for his experiments and this turns him into a chimp!"
"The best part is where Ollie falls down the chimney and loads of bricks land on his head, but he doesn't seem to suffer much pain from this.<br /><br />Dirty Work is Stan and Ollie at their funniest."
"Great fun.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars out of 5."
"Someday somebody is going to write an essay comparing Paul Naschy's ""Fury of the Wolfman"" to the great Spanish surrealist films, ""L'age D'or"" and ""Un Chien Andelou""."
"The Naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end."
"Dali and Bunuel probably loved it, and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull off.<br /><br />The film lacks cohesive structure even though it does have a plot that moves from A to B to C. Some mishmash about a ""Professor Walterman"" -- his first name, mind you -- who was bitten by a Yeti monster during an expedition to Tibet and hasn't been the same since, which is understandable."
"One of his jealous colleagues, the insane daughter of the noted Doctor Wolfstein, knows about his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him."
"But its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beast.<br /><br />""Walterman"" flips out, turns into a werewolf, kills a few people, is electrocuted, dies, is buried, unburied, taken to a castle filled with circus freaks, wired to various machines, zapped with assorted electronic effects, injected with potent elixirs, is chained up, turns into a werewolf, a woman in an evening gown with thigh-high Nazi fetish boots whips him, he escapes, helps the pretty female doctor find her way out of the castle, fends off the circus freaks with a battle axe, eventually turns back into a werewolf, and has to fight to the death against the female werewolf incarnation of his cheating wife."
"The lady with the Nazi boots shoots him with silver bullets from her Luger pistol, they die together, and the pretty doctor walks off into the morning with the studly reporter, who did nothing."
"""Look!"
"What a beautiful day it is!"""
"<br /><br />""La furia del Hombre Lobo"" was written by Paul Naschy in a hurry."
"Original director Enrique Eguilez was fired and replaced by Jos Mara Zabalza, a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production."
"He was often unable to work (though he did find time to instruct his 14 year old nephew to make some alterations to the script) and Naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited."
"Zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of Naschy's previous movies, ""Mark of the Wolfman""."
"The scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different, and helped pad out the runtime after Zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie."
"Post production was a nightmare."
"Nobody knew who was doing the editing, the money ran out, the master print disappeared for a while, and then at a pre-release screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find Zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater."
"He was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curb.<br /><br />Yet somehow the film works, if you let it."
"It keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles, vaulted catacombs, chains, whips, gloomy moors."
"Fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesn't make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution."
"In one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning; in the next shot its bone dry and he's howling at the full moon."
"Then its raining again."
"And yet you don't look at it as a gaffe."
"Its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible, opposites are the same, and effects proceed causes; First the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams, and then the cable starts sparking with electricity."
"People say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness -- I say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend."
"It is a marvel of making something out of nothing, and succeeds not because of what it could of had, but because of what it does."
"It's easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it."
"The trick is being able to see through the mayhem, or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effect.<br /><br />Paul Naschy died last week at the age of 75."
"He had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more, was working on film projects right up until his last days, but passed away in Madrid, Spain, with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment."
"His rich, varied, and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disinterest."
"And yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like ""Fury of the Wolfman"" in rapt awe."
"Even people who don't like Euro Horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at, if only for just a minute in a couple spots."
"You can find it for free at Archive.Org or even buy it on a DVD for a nickel."
"It's worth far, far more.<br /><br />Amusingly, Naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted, sick, demented little movie as a classic, if not an outright masterpiece of Cinema Dementia."
"The problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for Naschy to forgive."
"I would never presume to dare to forgive it for him, but I will say this: I'd rather watch ""Fury of the Wolfman"" in its dingiest, most cut and degraded fullscreen public domain print than ever sit though the overbearing, obnoxious crap churning out up at the Swine Flu cineplexes this or any other weekend.<br /><br />The world lost a great artist this month."
"Watch his films, and remember.<br /><br />9/10"
"Carlos Mencia was excellent this is hour special."
"He was working hard to show everybody he was the real deal."
"I know people have said he's stolen material in this special, but that is not true."
"Carlos brings comedy up front the way he wants it, not how anyone else wants it, that is why he is so good."
"People say he's not funny because he says Dee dee dee too much, and they still haven't realized thats part of his act, and they don't want it that way, but he brings it like that anyway, and succeeds in making people laugh."
"For all the haters out there, here is a message, Carlos is here to stay, you have no point in trying to bring him down."
"I recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her."
"The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen.<br /><br />After the original film, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other."
"Jane's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically, but also quite sexually in love.<br /><br />One's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually."
"And Jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality.<br /><br />The skin show in this film is off the charts."
"In addition to Jane's two-piece sexy midriff, leg, and hip baring costume, she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan."
"(although it is not O'Sullivan, but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene) Weissmuller, also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth."
"The ladies will delight when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips.<br /><br />It's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry."
"Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie."
"""The Invisible Mouse"" is a delightful and different Tom & Jerry's cartoon."
"It features the usual cat/mouse chases and battles, but in a different way this time."
"Jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of ""surprises"" for Tom, scare him, torment him and confuse him.<br /><br />As much as it is weird, it's also very cool and funny to see what we can't see: Jerry invisible."
"It's amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who's doing it (we know who, right?)"
"- it's like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts."
"It's equally amusing to see Jerry eating some candies and fruits while he's invisible."
"I really like that instrumental music which plays when he's not visible.<br /><br />Some of the best jokes on this short are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and slams him and even when Tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and Jerry writes ""Missed me""."
"I also like when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face.<br /><br />Overall, this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some nice artwork too."
"John Candy's Performance in Once Upon A Crime is possibly his best ever."
"It's been My Favourite Movie since it came out."
"I Spent 5 Years searching for it."
"That's How Good It Is."
"If You Disagree, well, that's your opinion."
"Enjoy The Movie."
"Here Italy (I write from Venice)."
"Why cancelated?"
"The ABC should have given it a chance to build an audience."
"The cast (w/Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've seen in recent."
"We need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless drones."
"I hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up."

"If you're one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as 'Book of the Dead', 'Book of Eibon' or 'Necronomicon', then you should feel right at home with Malefique, a film which also features an occult tome, one with the power to change the destinies of all involved."
"Discovered by four French prisoners sharing a cell, the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by Danvers, a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s; a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished."
"Finders of the book are Carrre (Grald Laroche) a company embezzler shopped by his wife, Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body-builds to execute an escape plan, the halfwit Pquerette (Dimitri Rataud) who once ate his baby sister, and the 'librarian' Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), supposedly driven mad by reading, who murdered his wife."
"Reminding the viewer of Meat Loaf's equally bizarre, bosomy male in Fight Club (1999), Lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet, one who is especially protective of the infantile Pquerette."
"With the coming of the book however, and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents, Marcus assumes greater and greater significance."
"At first assured of an early bail, meanwhile Carrre takes little more than academic interest in events."
"Suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and, as the prisoners experiment, Danvers' book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers...<br /><br />Staged for the most part within a prison cell, and between four or five characters, Malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter (as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers)."
"Only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell, a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed, closed-in nature of proceedings elsewhere."
"More than anything, this is a film about being trapped, either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding."
"""I'm going to escape,"" says Carrre at the start of the film, wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son."
"Whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price, and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an 'escape' may not be one a man might imagine.<br /><br />With all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first-time feature director Eric Vallette's credit that his film succeeds as well as it does."
"As critics have noticed, it is a film with strong Freudian overtones - Lassalle's distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance; the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye; the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus; Danvers' original placenta fetish; the dark cell as a primitive womb from which 'delivery' is awaited, etc."
"With so many interesting aspects to the script Vallette hardly puts a foot wrong, and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what, when one comes down to it, is just a matter of four guys, four bunks, one folding table and a book."
"There's a genuine, growing, Lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages, while one or two moments - the aforementioned blinking vagina, or what ultimately happens to Pquerette - are unsettlingly memorable."
"The pacing of many of the dark events in Malefique is deliberate, rejecting the rapid cutting of many Hollywood productions: a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick-fix action and gore."
"Perhaps this is a particularly European manner, as one recalls a similar, measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as Verhoeven's The Fourth Man (1983) - a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye.<br /><br />Lensed well in 1.85:1, Malefique benefits from excellent performances and, if for this viewer at least, the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been, the journey to the final shot was worth taking."
"Coming so soon after the release of the similarly well-received Haute Tension (aka: Switchblade Romance, 2003), this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the French industry, this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from Asia"
"This movie is very hilarious, and it has a great compilation of actors like William H. Macy which always have perform this kind of roles, maybe his most representative, Fargo; and George Clooney which is a very good actor showing his comedian work in brothers Cohen film ""Oh brother, where art thou?"""
"which results to be one of my favorite movies ever!"
"But it's been hard to find ""Welcome to Collinwood"", here in Mexico."
"My city lacks of good places where to buy some good films."
"I tried to buy it at Blockbuster but they don't know it by the original name, so maybe it will be a little easier to find if I have the name they gave to it in Mexico, do someone knows it?, because I can't remember!"
"Cheers."
"A."
"I havent seen that movie in 20 or more years but I remember the attack scene with the horses wearing gas-masks vividly, this scene ranks way up there with the best of them including the beach scene on Saving private Ryan, I recommend it strongly."
"Religious bigotry is rampant everywhere."
"Australia is not immune to it.<br /><br />A dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having ""killed"" her own baby."
"I don't mean to spoil the story for you, but you need to know the basics before getting knee-deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison.<br /><br />Buy or rent the movie and discover how deep-seated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globe.<br /><br />This is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors.<br /><br />Both Meryl Streep (with her famous Aussie accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is his native-born pronunciation, are outstanding."
"Those with supporting roles are also quite good.<br /><br />You will remember this movie for many years.<br /><br />See it!"
"Lexi befriends Jennifer, a thin, intelligent girl at her new school."
"Lexi's parents have just split up."
"Soon, Jen tells Lexi of her eating disorder, and the two begin dieting and exercising together."
"They both are in the school's volley ball team."
"Lexi's mum becomes aware of her daughter's illness, as she is losing lots of weight."
"Lexi is admitted to hospital."
"She is diagnosed with Anorexia nervosa, and is made to gain weight."
"Her father visits her in hospital, and orders a feeding tube."
"She is better and is allowed out of hospital and she tells her mum that Jen has bulimia."
"This leads to the two falling out, as Lexi's mum tells Jen's mum her suspicions.<br /><br />At a party Jen is hit by a car, and because her heart is weak it kills her."
"Lexi's condition worsens, as she blames herself for her best friend's death..."
"In this ""critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events, Gabriel (Robin Williams), a celebrated writer and late-night talk show host, becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (Toni Collette)."
"When troubling questions arise about this boy's (story), however, Gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret"" according to film's official synopsis.<br /><br />You really should STOP reading these comments, and watch the film NOW...<br /><br />The ""How did he lose his leg?"""
"ending, with Ms. Collette planning her new life, should be chopped off, and sent to ""deleted scenes"" land."
"It's overkill."
"The true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious, by the time Mr. Williams returns to New York."
"Possibly, her blindness could be in question - but a revelation could have be made certain in either the ""highway"" or ""video tape"" scenes."
"The film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a ""director's cut""?"
"<br /><br />Williams and Bobby Cannavale (as Jess) don't seem, initially, believable as a couple."
"A scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage."
"Otherwise, the cast is exemplary."
"Williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization, and not a ""gay impersonation""."
"Sandra Oh (as Anna), Joe Morton (as Ashe), and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are all perfect.<br /><br />Best of all, Collette's ""Donna"" belongs in the creepy hall of fame."
"Ms. Oh is correct in saying Collette might be, ""you know, like that guy from 'Psycho'."""
"There have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women, due to a slighter dispersion of roles; certainly, they could have noticed Collette with some award consideration."
"She is that good."
"And, director Patrick Stettner definitely evokes Hitchcock - he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful.<br /><br />Finally, writers Stettner, Armistead Maupin, and Terry Anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere.<br /><br />******* The Night Listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin"
"I really liked Tom Barman's AWTWB."
"You just have to let it come over you and enjoy it while it lasts, and don't expect anything."
"It's like sitting on a caf-terrace with a beer, in the summer sun, and watching the people go by."
"It definitely won't keep you pondering afterwards, that's true, but that's not a prerequisite for a good film."
"It's just the experience during the movie that's great.<br /><br />I felt there were a few strands that could have been worked out a little more, but being a Lynch fan I don't care that much anymore :)<br /><br />And I *loved* the style, or flair of this movie."
"It's slick, but fresh, and the soundtrack is a beauty."
"Any music-lover will get his kicks out of AWTWB, I can assure you.<br /><br />I'll give it 8 out 10.<br /><br />(music-wise 10 out of 10)"
"Being an Austrian myself this has been a straight knock in my face."
"Fortunately I don't live nowhere near the place where this movie takes place but unfortunately it portrays everything that the rest of Austria hates about Viennese people (or people close to that region)."
"And it is very easy to read that this is exactly the directors intention: to let your head sink into your hands and say ""Oh my god, how can THAT be possible!""."
"No, not with me, the (in my opinion) totally exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary, I watch porn, sure, but in this context I was rather disgusted than put in the right context.<br /><br />This movie tells a story about how misled people who suffer from lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons."
"A girl who is treated like a whore by her super-jealous boyfriend (and still keeps coming back), a female teacher who discovers her masochism by putting the life of her super-cruel ""lover"" on the line, an old couple who has an almost mathematical daily cycle (she is the ""official replacement"" of his ex wife), a couple that has just divorced and has the ex husband suffer under the acts of his former wife obviously having a relationship with her masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks her drivers the most unusual questions and stretches their nerves by just being super-annoying.<br /><br />After having seen it you feel almost nothing."
"You're not even shocked, sad, depressed or feel like doing anything... Maybe that's why I gave it 7 points, it made me react in a way I never reacted before."
"If that's good or bad is up to you!"
"I am proud to say I own an uncut copy of this choice chunk of 70's Crown International drive-in sexploitation comedy cheese on DVD."
"It's a really goofy and enjoyably inconsequential flick with a nicely breezy'n'easy 70's vibe to it."
"It does attempt to make a sincere point about true love and friendship being more important in life than a cool set of wheels and a quick piece of tail."
"Sure, it's essentially a blatant adolescent male fantasy pic -- the main teen goofus character Bobby Hamilton gets the girls, the respect of his friends, and a chance to show-up a local van-racing bully -- but it's way too dopey and good-natured to hate."
"Stuart Getz as our gawky protagonist makes for an endearingly dorky lead, Deborah White as the main object of Getz's affection is a definite cutie, Connie Lisa Marie is likewise quite luscious as a beauteous blonde babe, and sneering beefcake Neanderthal Stephan Oliver (a 60's biker movie perennial) is wonderfully hateful as the brutish Dugan Hicks."
"A pre-stardom Danny DeVito in particular is an absolute riot as Getz's cranky carwash owner boss Andy, a lovably cantankerous ne'er-do-well slob who wears very ugly loud Hawaiian shirts and suffers from a severe gambling habit."
"I especially love the scene where two thugs brutally beat Danny up -- one holds his arms behind his back while the other guy works over Danny's torso!"
"And Sammy Johns' insidiously catchy fluke hit theme song will be bouncing around your skull for at least a week."
"In short, it's great groovy retro-70's fun!"
"I also just got back from an advanced screening of Redeye and I must say I haven't had so much fun at a movie in a long time."
"WES CRAVEN is at his best ever."
"He brings us an amazing end of summer thriller I was so desperately craving."
"This is THE thriller of the year..no doubt."
"<br /><br />All the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun."
"The F/X were great."
"It steadily built suspense."
"I was on the edge of my seat most of the movie."
"It's been a while since I heard an audience cheer and clap and get excited in a theater."
"<br /><br />If your looking for thrills,action and a GOOD plot this summer, REDEYE delivers."
"Go see it!"
"""Pecker"" is a young, unknown photographer from Baltimore who becomes a big star in the public, the media and the local art scene with his pictures showing the dirty reality of all-day life just as dirty underwear or human excrements."
"It's a typical topic of John Waters Baltimore-based independent comedies to show the weird sides of the American way of life between political correctness fashion and conservative backlashes by exploring the backgrounds of the middle class society of his hometown.<br /><br />Edward Furlong of ""Terminator 2"" fame plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary Patricia Hearst and Water's long-time actress Mink Stole."
"Although the pacing of the plot becomes a big flaw sometimes and can't compete with the fast and furious joke attacks of Water's brilliant ""Serial Mom"", it's still has some good laughs in it and some unforgettable scenes like a former junkie-girl who became a vegetarian by sniffing peas from a vegetable dish... ""Pecker"" is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art scene, media hypes, middle-class sex angst and the strange ways of how to become a pop star without realizing it."
"Recommended!"
"Jim McKay has made one of the best films you will see all year.The quiet simplicity of this film draws you in from the opening shot and never lets go.There is not one false note in the entire film.Not one.Everything works.The hand-held camera is never distracting and always where it should be.The three young ladies whose lives we follow are always real.There isn't a single beat where the audience is reminded we are looking at actresses performing a role.These are just real girls trying to find themselves.There is no political agenda,hidden or otherwise.This is cinema at its most basic,and although it will probably only be seen by a handful of movie-goers,it deserves a much wider release.A special hats off to Hugh Hefner for providing the film-makers with the grant money needed to get this important film made.I can't wait to see what Mr. McKay does next."
"The wonderfully urbane Ronald Coleman is show-cased here as in few other of his films."
"He is literally in every scene and this comical movie remains fresh because of him, not in spite of him."
"He is handsome, witty and very clever here as he remains a step ahead of his wandering, lovely wife--played perfectly by Anna Lee."
"The movie is based on a french play and brings all the best qualities of that farce."
"Most of the supporting cast is well known, at least by face if not name...and are absolutely perfect for this very funny film."
"The fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable as he stays a step ahead of the other characters."
"His multi-talents can be further appreciated in the classic ""Lost Horizon"" which every film buff must see."
"I saw this movie when it first came out."
"It was an official selection for the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for it for best picture.<br /><br />Justine Priestley is hot as the psychotic, but complex Amanda."
"This is not your ordinary psycho movie."
"Lots of interesting and original slants on the genre."
"Sort of a ""Fatal Attraction"" for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in as the object of Amanda's affection is married to an up and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career takes off.<br /><br />"
"Perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is Otto Preminger's 'Where the Sidewalks Ends,' from a really excellent script by Ben Hecht based on the novel 'Night Cry' by Frank Rosenberg...<br /><br />Dana Andrews is the honest, tough New York policeman, always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong-arm methods as much as he detests crooks..."
"When he hit someone, his knuckles hurt... And the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain (Gary Merrill) who points up the title."
"'Why are you always trying to push me in the gutter?'"
"he asks Andrews."
"'I have as much right on the sidewalk as you."
"'<br /><br />Dana Andrew's obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden, painful discovery that he is the son of a thief... His deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them, and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta...<br /><br />By a twist of irony unique to the film itself, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney of 'Laura' are united once more, and Andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later, but no longer the romantic, beaten down by his job, by the cheap crooks..."
"This time, he goes too far, and accidentally kills a suspect..."
"The killing is accidental, the victim worthless, yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail...<br /><br />Using his knowledge of police procedure, he covers up his part in the crime, plants false clues, and tries to implicate a gang leader, but cannot avoid investigating the case himself..."
"The double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder, is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical, satisfying, and in no way a compromise...<br /><br />The film is one of the best detective films of the 50's, with curious moral values, also one of Preminger's best... <br /><br />Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique, projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism..."
"Though not in the whole film, Andy Griffith again plays his role best in this CBS tv-movie."
"The plot is easy-Griffith's character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named (Mountains Somewhere)."
"Though it will never be seen on TV and never be released on video, if you do get the chance to watch this--TAKE IT."
"Belushi at his most ingratiating and Courtney Cox before Friends has a small role."
"I often think Belushi is under-used in Hollywood and this film role is one of his best."
"For those of you who watch his TV show, this is a very different and likable character."
"The movie itself is not earth shattering, nor is the message new but rather it is sweet and endearing."
"The supporting cast of familiar faces and unfamiliar names is a perfect balance although Lovitz's whining can get tiresome, and Michael Caine's charming spiritual guide has a slightly sinister if not well-meaning edge."
"Hamilton, as Belushi's wife is unfortunately two-dimensional and one wonders why he married her."
"In addition, Renee Russo is wasted and not terribly convincing at the ""prom queen"" who got away."
"Nevertheless, a nice way to spend two hours."
"This episode apparently grew out of the cold war."
"There has been a holocaust but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come through unscathed."
"It then becomes a battle for turf."
"She is attracted to him and vice versa, but the instinct for survival takes over."
"It's a quiet, slow moving, chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust."
"They come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again."
"Of course, the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive."
"But it still is captivating and interesting."
"Because she doesn't speak, we don't know here mind very well, but in the end we can guess."
"Colman's performance is aided by the brilliantly written script."
"The gargantuan Hollywood studios in the 30's and 40's were able to copy some of the German expressionistic film elements and incorporate them into Hollywood films."
"very good use of shadows and light and silhouette."
"i really liked the scene where colman turns off the light in his dressing room near the beginning of the film, and he starts reciting Othello while his face becomes instantly dark and evil."
"already the viewer sees the text and the drama of Shakespeare getting a hold of ""Tony"" and off he goes on his journey of doom."
"i also enjoyed the dramatic death scene within the play, when he becomes overwrought with emotion and accidentally strangles his costar a little too hard for her to bear."
"her pleadings ""tony stop you're hurting me"" are chilling and suspenseful."
"you just don't know if he is going to go over the top and kill her at any moment."
"the cat and mouse chase to reveal the killer was nicely added 2/3rds of the way through the film to add some faster pacing and to also add to the narrative element of the film."
"Masterful work from George Cukor."
"He's such as skillful director."
"Excellent film."
"Too bad they don't make 'em like they used to..."
"Two thirds of nearly 2,000 IMDb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8, 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes (Was this a record, or merely a faulty VCR?)."
"Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination."
"But for some reason I imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it."
"My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim's original book."
"My wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form."
"Such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things, but I gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing, although in no way syrupy, and was also very well written."
"I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film, and so decided to buy her the videotape."
"I am now very glad that I did, and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre-Mussolini Italian atmosphere."
"The story is set in the immediate post WW1 period and starts with two married London ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together, away from their families, in a rented villa in Italy."
"Force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds."
"Its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses, not only between these four very disparate mature ladies, but also with the occasional male visitor."
"If you want action, thrills, dramatic sex scenes, natural or man-made disasters, or Harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you."
"But IMDb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch, and if you care to give it a try you may, as I did, come to rank it among your much loved films.<br /><br />It is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which I am already familiar."
"In many cases I find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film, but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that I actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book, effectively unrolled before my eyes."
"(Perhaps Italy itself has some part in this, the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from Boccaccio's Decameron on TV.)"
"Generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal, but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events."
"This works very well, although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story."
"Great credit is due to the Director, Mike Newell, and all members of the cast, particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies."
"I found this movie quite by accident, but am happy that I did."
"Kenneth Branagh's performance came close to stealing this movie from Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie."
"This movie brought to mind the excellent movies that Branagh made with Emma Thompson."
"Carter's star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as I have seen from a female lead in a long time."
"Portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off, but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life, she made it so believable."
"If this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women ""uglying"" themselves up for roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I fell sure Carter would have had strong consideration for an Oscar."
"If you run across this movie on cable late at night as I did, trust me, it is worth the lost sleep."
"After 7 years of watching that dreadful nonsense called Star Trek Voyager I was feeling pretty numb."
"Next Gen and DS9 were bloody good stuff and Voyager ruined TV Trek."
"This opened with probably the best pilot to a Trek show."
"The crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts."
"Scott Bakula played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before."
"The rest of the crew were really likable in their roles and I think they got off to a good first season."
"When the show was prematurely canceled I was really disappointed."
"In A Mirror Darkly showed us what the cast were capable of."
"Pity a film or TV movie was never considered."
"So much back story and founding of the federation left to tell, including the onset of hostilities with the Klingons.........."
"Seeing as Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of TV, it was a foregone conclusion i was gonna go to the movies and spend $15 on this."
"I also think this applies to Eva Longoria fans.<br /><br />The movie revolves around a leak that a Secret Service agent is planning to assassinate the President."
"As the investigation unfolds, it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas)."
"Pleading innocence, Pete goes on the fun, fugitive style, to search for the truth.<br /><br />It's solid, but certainly not spectacular."
"A decent cast, a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty, but you could certainly do far worse."
"I had a heck of a good time viewing this picture, and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features."
"First off, the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props."
"The acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers), barely professional(Herb Evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement(Leslie Daniels as the assistant Kurt)to first-rate with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions."
"The scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this ilk."
"Issues abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be."
"This film is a thinking film in many ways."
"However, don't be too fooled by its real intent."
"It is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with his aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together his dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul."
"One other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties."
"Although some may call it a ""Cuban Cinema Paradiso"", the movie is closer to a How Green Was My Valley, a memory film mourning for a lost innocence."
"The film smartly avoids falling into a political trap of taking sides (pro-Castro?"
"anti-Castro?, focusing instead in the human frailty of the characters and the importance of family."
"Filled with good acting, in particular from Mexican actress Diana Bracho, who plays Keitel's wife."
"A masterpiece, filled with references to classic movies, from CASABLANCA to Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS."
"Gael Garcia Bernal plays a small role which is critical for the dramatic payoff of the story."
"TV director Georg Stanford Brown, in a rare return to acting (remember THE ROOKIES?"
"), plays a homeless bum who acts as Greek chorus, superbly."
"It is a pity that this movie, originally titled DREAMING OF JULIA, has been released in the States by THINKfilm with the atrocious title of CUBAN BLOOD, which has nothing to do with the movie."
"in 1976 i had just moved to the us from ceylon."
"i was 23, and had been married for a little over three years, and was beginning to come out as a lesbian."
"i saw this movie on an old black and white TV, with terrible reception, alone, and uninterrupted, in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story."
"i was living in a small house in tucson arizona, and it was summertime... like everyone else here, i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth, and its residue of fragile magic, and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday."
"i'll keep checking in."
"i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley verel's 'the other side of venus'."
"it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy..."
"I would firstly say that somehow I remember seeing this movie in my early childhood, I couldn't read the subtitles and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery."
"But I did really like the concept."
"If you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie."
"That said, having just watched the restored 137 minute version on DVD I have to say I enjoyed it, though not as much as when I was seven ( I remembered the ending )."
"<br /><br />There are aspects of the movie that are worthy of criticism , the first 15 minutes and final 15 minutes both have some really comic moments, my favourite being the contrast between scenes acted out in the final 10 minutes and the curious choice of backing music ( listen to the lyrics )."
"<br /><br />For an action film there is a great deal of focus on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the strain of their time travel takes its toll."
"By the ending of the movie I had decided that this was a good thing, when seven I though the 'relationship' guff was a bad thing.<br /><br />For an action film there is also plenty of gratifying gory action, especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of Shogun era warriors."
"The makers of the movie have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and, lets face it, humorous."
"I thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when I was a kid, and I am not ashamed to say that I still do.<br /><br />I also like the fact that the modern day soldiers in general don't spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space time continuum, they've got heavy calibre machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, a tank and a helicopter and they're hell bent on making feudal Japan theirs."
"Which is what I'd like to think any vigorous IMDb user would do in their boots.<br /><br />In short the movies worth watching, it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise, and at the same time offers some hefty hints as to why a movie like G.I."
"Samurai is so unique."
"This may be the only film that actually comes close to capturing on film the essentially uncapturable world of the American college experience of the late 60s-early 70s."
"Go ahead, name another movie that even approaches this one: ""Getting Straight""?"
"""RPM""?"
"These are caricatures."
"""Return of the Secaucus Seven"" has its moments, but that's a retrospective film about (self-obsessed) individuals more than a film about a time and a place depicted *in* that time and place."
"""Drive, He Said"" portrays-- with subtlety and nuance where it should, and a swift kick in the shorts where that's the only appropriate way-- the anti-draft movement, the ambiguity of big-time college sports (especially when there's a war on), the sexual revolution of the period, and the general unreality of the day."
"Believe me, it was like that.<br /><br />The whole cast deserves commendation (as does the director, of course) but particular praise should be reserved for Bruce Dern, as the basketball coach, and Karen Black, the hero's very unusual-- except for that time-- love interest."
"William Tepper, as the lead, also rates a real round of applause both for his perfect capturing of the student-athlete of the period and for actually playing real college basketball in the film (remember Anthony Perkins in ""Tall Story""?"
"Yikes!"
").<br /><br />All in all, a classic of a kind-- and the last film someone currently in 6th grade should be writing comments on (""boring"", ""repellent""-- um, right, sonny, please go back to your Arnold movies)."
"Why isn't this film available from imdb?"
"""Fear of a Black Hat"" is a superbly crafted film."
"I was laughing almost continuously from start to finish."
"If you have the means, I highly recommend viewing this movie It is, by far, the funniest movie I have had the pleasure to experience."
"Grab your stuff!"
"I saW this film while at Birmingham Southern College in 1975, when it was shown in combination with the Red Balloon."
"Both films are similar in their dream-like quality."
"The bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner, a little boy, is away at school."
"A cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are, and begins to warily stalk his ""prey."""
"The boy begins his walk home from school, and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend."
"The fish becomes agitated by the cat's presence, and finally jumps out of the bowl!"
"The cat quickly walks over to the fish, gently picks him up with his paws, and returns him to his bowl."
"The boy returns happily to his fish, none the wiser.<br /><br />The ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity."
"It is hard to imagine how the director could've pulled the technical feat back in 1959 -- it seems more a trick for 2003.<br /><br />If you can find it, watch it -- you won't be disappointed!"
"And if you *do* find it, let me know so I can get a copy, too!"
"One of the best documentaries released in recent years."
"Some points...<br /><br />1."
"Hugo Chavez was elected Venezuela's president in 1998, his support largely coming from the poorer regions of Venezuela.<br /><br />2."
"In 2002, a coup briefly deposed Chavez."
"At the time, Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were in Caracas, shooting a documentary about Chavez for British television."
"Their film deconstructs the coup and its aftermath, and electrifyingly records history unfolding on-the-spot, outside and inside the presidential palace.<br /><br />3."
"Chavez aimed to free Venezuela from the free-market policies imposed on it by the US."
"Though Venezuela's oil was already state-owned, it was run for private benefit by executives who Chavez wished to replace.<br /><br />4."
"Despite being the world's fourth largest oil supplier, Venezuela remains swamped by poverty, its resources literally sucked away by foreign multinational corporations.<br /><br />5."
"The documentary begins by portraying Chavez's first years as president before the coup."
"It focuses on his popularity with the poor, and his various policies which proved popular with working class locals (educational plans, distribution of the oil revenue, grass-root democracy etc).<br /><br />6."
"Chavez was a huge proponent of education, and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution, encouraging children and adults to study and understand it.<br /><br />7."
"When Chavez came to power, he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits."
"This, understandably, made the oil companies nervous.<br /><br />8."
"A media-war broke out."
"The six private TV stations promptly began opposing the state-run TV station."
"They questioned Chavez's motives, sanity and sexual orientation.<br /><br />9."
"Without media support, the coup would not have been successful."
"The film makes it clear that coups rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and that news can be easily fabricated.<br /><br />10."
"Under the guise of ""re-establishing democracy"", the opposition silenced the state-run TV station, dissolved the National Electoral Board, Supreme Court, National Assembly and took control of the military.<br /><br />11."
"Moneyed interests, backed by the military elite (encouraged by the US and CIA), organised a citizens' march on the presidential palace to effect the coup."
"Snipers shot at Chvez supporters, but the private media stations edited footage so it appeared that return fire was aimed at the opposition march that in fact had been safely diverted.<br /><br />12."
"Police went on a shooting rampage against Chavez supporters, further bloodying the streets.<br /><br />13."
"Chavez, held captive, refused to resign."
"Of course the media/government then lied, saying he had resigned, but Chavez's cabinet members communicated the truth to the international community, which eventually got the message back to Venezuela by cable TV.<br /><br />14."
"The people rose up, pressuring the return of the president they had elected, whom only a referendum could constitutionally replace.<br /><br />8.9/10 - At a little over an hour long, this doc is far too short."
"Nevertheless, its an engrossing piece of journalism and deals with a form of ""media warfare"" which rarely gets touched upon."
"Makes a great companion piece to ""The Battle of Algiers"".<br /><br />Worth one viewing."
"This is hardly a movie at all, but rather a real vaudeville show, filmed for the most part ""in proscenium"", and starring some of the greatest stage stars of the day."
"""Singing in the Bathtub"" is an absolutely amazing production number that must be seen-- be sure to wear your shower cap!"
"First it was Jack The Ripper, now it is Alan Feinstone."
"The crazy dentist tortures people in horrific ways."
"Quite realistic at times but some of the acting is abysmal and comical."
"Especially from Corbin Bernson."
"In some scenes there is dental torture that will really make you cringe."
"Perfect cast for a few-person drama."
"Simon is dead but somehow resurrects from outside."
"What he had seen there is displayed in form of blank spots orchestrated to a magnificent score by German avant-garde composer Werner Henze."
"Simon is haunted by his death, comforted by support of death people he'd seen on the other side."
"His girlfriend tries to hold him to life but failing to, decides to follow him after his finally occurring death."
"Very touchy and moving, deeply psychological, but a bit slow and somewhere even boring."
"Having read Diamond's book, I was slightly disappointed in the series, but all in all, it is quite informative."
"Reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work, seeing 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' under every rug.<br /><br />Is Diamond a little preachy ?"
"Sure."
"Like a lot of academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever."
"He uses the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series."
"We get it, after about the first 10 minutes.<br /><br />Is Diamond a little simplistic (in the series) ?"
"Sure."
"The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly amusing, condensing some very long, complicated history down to 'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes."
"But the point remains valid - these things did in fact contribute (but not totally define) the reasons for the Spaniard's success against the established cultures.<br /><br />Is he preaching *against* Western Civilization in any way ?"
"Nope."
"Not a word."
"Not to my ear."
"All he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly, *not* that luck is the only reason.<br /><br />In the end, if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you."
"But if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail, this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence."
"Our Song is a marvelous example of passionate, movie making at its aesthetic best."
"It is, in fact, a genuine wonder of a movie; a penetrating and insightful work of art that chronicles the lives of three young inner city (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) girls during a particular summer in their lives when the perplexities of their approaching adulthood will compel each of them to make a number of difficult, life altering choices that will likely re-define who each of them is, as well as how they will continue to relate to one another in years to come.<br /><br />Jim McKay's writing/direction is graceful and uncluttered."
"There is no sappy, gratuitous sentimentality nor are there clich ridden solutions in this film."
"What we see here seems, at times, to be heart breakingly real."
"There is a naturalism - a credibility, if you will - in Our Song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High.<br /><br />Much of the credit for the film's spirit goes to its principle actors."
"The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha), and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is dazzlingly powerful."
"It would be easy - and, of course, blatantly obtuse - to dismiss, as some apparently have, the performances of these three as apathetic or unemotional."
"In fact, their quiet charm, their instinctive sense of dignity and their raw, sometimes unconventional intelligence, throughout the film, are absolutely riveting."
"One would have to be completely ""out of touch"" with, or completely indifferent to, the behavior of teenagers to miss the resounding authenticity in what these three young ladies bring to the screen."
"Likewise, the supporting cast, particularly Marlene Forte as Lanisha's mother, compliments the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film.<br /><br />Our Song is a film not to be missed - by anyone of any age."
"Curly Sue is a 6 year old with an abundance of hair and a life as a drifter."
"She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), try to survive on the streets by being small time con artists."
"In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in a pricey parking garage while Curly will scream about lawsuits and traction to the intended victim."
"It happens to be a very upscale lawyer named Grey (Kelly Lynch) who is appropriately appalled at what she has done."
"Not only do the scammers make some cash, they get to spend the night at Grey's plush apartment."
"Even then, Grey feels she owes them more so the three of them hang together for a spell."
"Grey only knows the lucrative law business and nothing about life."
"Who better to teach her than Bill and Curly, those savvy experts on life's realities?"
"But, all good things must come to an end and there is no life for a legal expert and a couple of con men."
"Or is there?"
"This is a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected."
"Curly is certainly as entertaining as Shirley Temple but much edgier, of course."
"Belushi gives a rare touching performance as the down on his luck con and Lynch is luminous as the snooty but soft touch lawyer."
"John Hughes, as writer and director, shows us his magic touch once again, as the script is lively and unpredictable."
"Just watch Curly and Bill take Grey out for a night, with no money, and see the humorous results."
"Do you long for happy endings, long promised and finally delivered, with a few uncertain moments in between?"
"This is your made-to-order movie."
"I cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers."
"They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past."
"I would like to see a comment from someone who had never seen Basic Instinct 1, perhaps someone very young ?"
"I left the cinema feeling glad that I had not been swayed by the IMDb reviewers."
"14 hours later I am still trying to find flaws in the plot but I cannot think of anything serious."
"My advice to everyone is see it for yourself and make up your own mind.<br /><br />It follows a similar pattern to Basic Instinct 1 but the plot is less confused."
"It still left me wondering at the end but in a more satisfactory way."
"Sharon Stone is as sexy and evil as before and wears her 48 years extremely well; this remains her defining role."
"David Morrisey was satisfactory even though he is no Michael Douglas."
"Of the supporting cast I particularly liked David Thewlis as the police detective."
"Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways."
"First, it's a fan made series, available only on the web, and it features mainly friends & neighbors who have the computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines to, as Mickey & Judy once put it, put on a show."
"It's definitely friends & neighbors to, you can tell."
"A lot of these people aren't the most beautiful looking folks you've ever seen, or the youngest, or the thinnest some of them stumble through their lines like they're walking on marbles some of them have thick accents, or simply don't seem to speak well in the first place, whick makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word that they're saying."
"Still, you have to admit, for everything these friends & neighbors have put together, it's actually fun to watch."
"Yes, some of the dialogue is hokey."
"Yes, it's a little odd (though admittedly a little cool too) watching two Starfleet males kiss (although some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on.)"
"Yes, you cringe a bit when they clearly quote from ST:TOS, TNG, other shows and the movies, or when you hear the theme from Galaxy Quest played at the beginning and end of every show."
"Okay."
"We can get by that."
"Why?"
"The graphics are first rate."
"Better than almost anything you've seen."
"And sometimes, a show or two really stands out story-wise some of them are actually real tear-jerkers.<br /><br />Hidden Frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due."
"It takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude."
"People, sets, costumes, graphics it's a huge effort on a lot of people's parts."
"We watch, we return, and we thank them."
"Being the Beatlemaniac that I am, I approached Two Of Us with a combination of fear and fascination."
"Having seen 'In His Life: The John Lennon Story', I was quite concerned that Two Of Us will turn out no better."
"The fact that Aidan Quinn and Jared Harris look absolutely nothing like John Lennon and Paul McCartney  even with some make-up and proper hairdos  didn't help one bit.<br /><br />But I was more than a bit pleasantly surprised."
"It's probably thanks to the involvement of Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who directed Let It Be in 1970 and consequently probably knew John and Paul quite well, that the characters and the dialogue came across as convincing as they did."
"(The writing credit for Two Of Us is given to a man named Mark Stanfield, of whom I know absolutely nothing; I feel confident that director Lindsay-Hogg had more than a bit to do with the script.)"
"Two Of Us is not a biography of the Beatles; it has very little plot, in fact, and takes place all in one day in New York City."
"What it does is imagine a meeting between John and Paul in 1976, while John lived in New York."
"That meeting is entirely fictitious, of course  though it can't truly be disproved that such a meeting actually took place."
"But through that imagined conversation it gives us a glimpse into the personalities of these two great musicians  their intelligence, their sense of humor, their different reaction to stardom, and most of all their relationship; what made them such a great team, and what broke them up.<br /><br />Since it's a talk movie, nothing much except for dialogue between two characters for an hour and a half, it's likely to bore all but true fans of the Beatles; but it's a fantastic piece of writing and storytelling, and is both informative and touching."
"For those interested in these two musical giants, very quickly you'll get over the shock of how different the actors look from their counterparts and feel like John and Paul had come to life  so intimate and convincing is the script, and so committed are the actors."
"Two Of Us gives you priceless insight into the lives of two geniuses, and a tale that is both sad and funny."
"Most certainly recommended."
"This was great."
"When I saw the Japanese version first, it was probably the scariest movie I had ever seen."
"It was not blood and guts, it was eerie, atmospheric and terrifying."
"When the mother ghost lent over the bed in the Japanese version, I nearly had a heart attack..."
"I was concerned that the American version would be watered down, and that Buffy would take away from the dark creepy nuances of the original version."
"I needn't have been concerned."
"The makers of this movie wisely kept the same Japanese people who were involved with the original movie on hand, and gave the direction of the movie to the same man."
"They also set it in Japan in the same location, in the same house."
"In fact, the Japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original, the only difference was the casting of American actors."
"That actually turned into a benefit as it added the element of ""Strangers in a Strange Land"" to the overall horror."
"Not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost, but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land, having difficulty integrating into society."
"It just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and I thought it was an excellent touch.<br /><br />Buffy actually does a very good job."
"She looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well."
"There are none of the smart aleck remarks that are so common to American horror movies, or one liners that detract from the overall darkness and horror of the characters' situation."
"In fact, it was easily as good as The Ring which I also thoroughly enjoyed."
"I hope the future of American horror follows more closely the Japanese New Wave of horror started with the incredible success of Ringu."
"We are finally getting movies that actually can be categorized as ""Horror""!!"
"8/10"
"I found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid-50's white mans body."
"He doesn't realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before."
"He listens to rap music, sings along, and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man."
"The real humor in this movie was watching the trouble that this behavior gets him into with the black community."
"I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be as well done as they were, nor did I expect them to be cast in such an artistic well-developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original."
"This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and I'll be on the lookout for the next movie like it."
"I especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie, but it wasn't a cheesy vampire flick, nor did it over embellish that fact."
"The characters all had human traits."
"The way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful, and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives."
"I give this movie two thumbs so far up."
"Definitely the best movie I have seen in the past five years."
"I own Ralph Bakshis forgotten masterpiece Fire & Ice on an old OOP rental videotape.<br /><br /> Well for one thing, this is better than any other Conan-esque film you'll ever see."
"Sure, it's cheesy, but who cares?"
"It stood the test of time, and the only way it started to look cheesy is in comparisons to modern fantasy epics like LOTR:FOTR (though I love that film."
")<br /><br /> The plot goes like this: After a battle between Fire & Ice, a kings daughter is kidnapped by Jarols (Ice) subhuman creatures, while a sole survivor of a victimized village rescues her.<br /><br /> Yeah it doesn't sound as a original as Nurse Betty, but that's not the point."
"It is really to bring to life an interesting idea of a world of two enemies: Fire & Ice."
"And it succeeds.<br /><br /> As for the action scenes: superb."
"They are well handled, have terrific suspence, and have plenty of loud noises."
"Just check out the climatic battle, now THAT'S an ending!<br /><br /> The acting and dialogue: competent."
"Really."
"They aren't gonna be nominated for an Oscar, but they are OK and don't get on your nerves.<br /><br /> The animation is quite good."
"Shot on 3D and rotoscoped (I THINK), it looks pretty good."
"A lot of the backgrounds look really detailed and well drawn, and although the character designs feel a little 1-dimentional, they are OK.<br /><br /> Overall, this is a fine neglected little gem and will entertain you more than any of the superfical ""entertainment""."
"10/10"
"This was a good movie."
"It wasn't your typical war flick but something a bit different."
"This movie showed us recruits in training before the war and not actually fighting a war."
"This film is one of the more realist views on war and the army than most other films like this made."
"Colin Farrel did a great job at portraying an army recruit and Clifton Collins Jr and also Matthew Davis contributed reasonably well."
"Seeing Colin Farrel move from b grade to a grade in a few short years, You would never thought it would happen."
"I will also add that the makers of tigerland did a great job at filming a movie in the year 2000 and making it look like 1970 was a good touch."
"Its good to see talent used wisely and i hope to see this same talent again in the near future."
"Absolutely stunning, warmth for the head and the heart."
"The kind of movie western movie makers are too rushed, too frenetic to even attempt."
"My kids watched it, and they loved it too."
"What real people--goes to show you how cultural differences (the Japanese setting) is less important than the human similarities."
"Go see it, whether you like dancing or not."
"Renny Harlin's first American film was one of the best of a slew of prison-set horror films(like ""Death House"" or ""The Chair"")in the late 80's.Twenty years before,guard Lane Smith had wrongfully executed a condemned man.Now,he is the warden of the newly re-opened prison,and the man's ghost is back for bloody revenge.This atmospheric and very moody film features lots of gruesome gore and violence.Viggo Mortensen,Tiny Lister,Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are onhand for the entertaining carnage."
"this film was almost a great imaginative film."
"A mixture of shakespeare, pop, jazz, and faerie tales."
"This movie was an imaginative twist on the Cinderella theme."
"Featuring a strong cast, headed by the perfectly cast Kathleen Turner, this movie had everything going for it."
"Everything but production values."
"I almost never think that a movie needs special effects or big budgets, but with an over the top production like this, it came off with the same seedy quality as every other made for tv movie."
"Besides better cinematography, this film was almost perfect.<br /><br />"
"I have NOT seen this movie, but I must."
"Having read all three of Thor Heyerdahl's books (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku) I am actively looking for a copy of this movie.<br /><br />The thesis that Peruvians migrated to Polynesia is alive and well."
"Considering that this crew had NO GPS, and only an old fashioned valve (tube) radio with a 6-watt output, their voyage was heroic to say the least.<br /><br />Please reply to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video.<br /><br />I would be interested in buying it."
"This was one of the all time best episodes."
"Officer Sean Cooper was murdered in his patrol car back in '68."
"A dying convict in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting."
"His case is reopened with the presumption that he was corrupted as a policeman.<br /><br />Further investigation into him as a police officer and a human being reveals a war veteran involved in a forbidden love."
"This type of love was considered shameful and something to at least keep hidden at that time.<br /><br />While this isn't the type of love I personally support, he was still a policeman and a human being and shouldn't have been killed for it."
"The sound track was excellent (keeps me watching the DVR), and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to emphasize one object or give a particular feeling to a scene was especially appealing."
"I shall be watching this one in repeat!"
"Alright this was quite a sensitive little number but I can't help thinking I've seen it before."
"Reminds me of another VCA film I saw at Poitier called ""THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE"" Also had specks of ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Ratcatcher"" and Lynne Ramsay in it's execution."
"Which is not to say that they're not tasteful references...just that they feel very modern and very fashionable...which makes me feel like this is closer to advertising (as an approach in style and story) than the work of an original and authentic auteur to come.<br /><br />The cinematography is just...too perfect for my liking."
"Too coral filter (or charcoal) for my liking...too archly framed 12mm."
"Therefore the entire impression left me a little distant -- beware of art that proclaims itself too readily!"
"The french (they are a conservative bunch) seemed to buy it as did the jury however... but Cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to it's feature selection although I wonder what's been happening in the last few years."
"Tiempo de Valientes fits snugly into the buddy action movie genre, but transcends its roots thanks to excellent casting, tremendous rapport between its leads, and outstanding photography."
"Diego Peretti stars as Dr. Silverstein, a shrink assigned to ride shotgun with detective Diaz (Luis Luque), who's been assigned to investigate the murder of two minor hoods who seem to have been involved in am arms smuggling conspiracy."
"Diaz has been suspended from duty, but he's the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be reinstated."
"Silverstein and Diaz soon find themselves enmeshed in a conspiracy involving Argentina's intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separates them at a crucial point that allows Silverstein to develop some impressive sleuthing skills of his own."
"Peretti and Luque are excellent together and remind me of screen team Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, though Peretti isn't as classically handsome as Hill."
"Remarkably, even at almost two hours in length Tiempo de Valientes doesn't wear out its welcome, and indeed writer-director Damian Szifron sets up a potential sequel in the film's charming coda."
"All in all, a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither panders to the lowest common denominator nor insults your intelligence."
"I must say that I really had no idea that I was going to sit down and watch this movie."
"I guess it was the fact that I had nothing better to do between class."
"But, for once a TV movie caught my interest."
"More importantly Helen Hunt caught my eye."
"I really wasn't a big fan of hers prior to this film."
"Sure I liked Twister and As Good As It Gets."
"But, something about this movie really did it for me."
"I would now see myself as a huge fan."
"This movie comes with high marks from...me."
"Give it a chance, it won't let you down."
"Grand Canyon is a very strange bird."
"It's a completely unique urban piece, where relating the entire plot would fail to convey much.<br /><br />It's central theme seems to be the inherent uncertainty life holds for people of every race, background and station."
"But to proclaim that THE theme of the film would be to horribly understate its scope."
"Similarly, to pigeonhole it in a particular genre is futile.<br /><br />The film has volumes to say, though likely different volumes for every viewer, and says it all in such a non-preachy way from so many angles, that in the end, i can't even define its central message for myself.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it does it's business with such laser precision; every prop, line of dialog, and bar of background music contributing to it's pervasive mood and powerful message, that i'm pleasantly surprised, and come away very thoughtful after every viewing."
"Still it doesn't feel at all stuffy."
"A sparkling film with a great cast and everything working."
"Every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror,diamonds are crafted, and one becomes completely awestruck by its sheer brilliance."
"This is no less than a diamond!!"
"This is a film brimful of eeriness,chilling anticipation, and dark atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say, one of my favourite horror films of all time!"
"And of course it contains probably the single most, flat out scary sequence in the whole of history of horror!"
"Every time I see the film, and it gets up to the point where you know the inevitably will happen, I try to remember exactly when I will be frightened out of my wits, but it never fails to happen; I never get it right, and I find myself as terrorized as the first time I saw it!!"
"Now, it must be said, to scare a jaded horror fan like that, that is nothing short of pure perfection."
"Unlike the Americans, the Brits know their subtleties, they take pride in the art of acting, they do not need any special effect in order to convey atmosphere, they rely on the power of the potent story, and the creepiness(in this case)of suggestion and anticipation."
"Every single element is impeccable, from the set pieces, the acting, the story, to the menacing atmosphere."
"Pauline Moran surely could make the devil whimper, that's for sure!!"
"As an end note, if you for some demented reason don't like this piece of insanity, then you honestly don't know what horror is all about, and frankly do not deserve to know it either."
"Thank you!"
"In ten words or less to describe this film, Barbara Stanwyck is too appealing and it is great!"
"The film is wonderful, except for the perhaps tacked-on ending, but I love happy endings anyway."
"Barbara Stanwyck, however, as the platinum-blonde gold-digger is amazing."
"She knows what she wants and goes after it!"
"This film is sexy and excellent!"
"I do see what my forebears saw in the youthful Bette Davis."
"She's splendid throughout this almost-madcap political comedy which actually stars Warren Williams as the political operative constantly behind on his alimony."
"Vivienne Osborne is brilliant as his ex, and I found myself rooting for her throughout."
"The Williams character is not at all sympathetic, and he's not even a decent op.<br /><br />Guy Kibbee is one of the best at what he does."
"As a candidate dragged out of his sleep at a political convention and nominated to be governor in order to prevent a rival candidate from being nominated, so this whole mess is borne of internecine political warfare in a party called the ""Progressive Party."""
"If you're of a political mind, you will probably see a party other than the one with which you are affiliated reflected in the fictional ""Progressive Party"" of Williams and Kibbee."
"I could draw exact parallels, but we're not here for that.<br /><br />This is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies."
"If you've ever watched any of the old Wheeler & Woolsey titles (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, THE RAINMAKERS), you'll find Frank McHugh, as Williams's right arm, looking and behaving a lot like Bert Wheeler."
"He had me fooled.<br /><br />Yes, both my wife and I recommend this one."
"When you start watching this animation-masterpiece, you quickly notice, that it's a European production."
"Although the Europeans have (sadly) integrated some of the clichs you would normally find in an American production of this kind, most are missing."
"One of these is that there is an overwhelming evil that only our (very few and very unlikely) heroes can vanquish."
"Another is that one of the group is only in the business for the money, is greedy, runs away when the heat is up but somehow gives in to his better nature."
"This movie would have been better off without both.<br /><br />The movie is based upon a TV-Series that was out four years before the movie."
"Unlike the movie, the TV-Series is a cartoon and not a computer animation."
"At first I thought the computer would kill the charm and character of the plot but I was quickliy convinced: Whoever did the animation knew his or her stuff!"
"Although the characters are obviously fictional (in stills they don't even look real), they seem as alive and sentient as the audience following their quest."
"Making characters who by ""normal"" standards could be considered deformed (those micro-legs could never carry that giant body let alone make it jump) so alive and lovable is more than ""just a highlight""!"
"The creation of the world is another masterpiece."
"Not so much because of its looks but because of the inventiveness of it."
"The world our heroes travel is not solid like our own but is made of many pieces of land varying in shape and size that seem to be floating in mid air."
"When a person steps on a smaller fragment of ground, it nods a little bit as if feathering from the weight."
"In some cases up and down no longer apply but our heroes still manage to get a foothold somewhere."
"Although the world of floating islands is completely surreal, in this movie it is absolutely believable and after a short time it doesn't seem any weirder than running into a car somewhere in New York.<br /><br />I wrote that the looks of the world aren't as breathtaking as the idea."
"As true as that might be to my mind, the quality of the world, the characters and the attention to details is staggering."
"Although the faces of the characters have relatively few attributes, emotions can be read as clearly as in Sean Connery's or Dustin Hoffman's face."
"The world around the characters is wonderfully colourful and no two settings are alike."
"The background is always in motion, something is always going on which makes the world seem even more alive."
"If you stop the movie and look at the background you will be surprised how many details you can find.<br /><br />The existence of Hector actually puts the cherry on top."
"Hector is a furry little ""thing"" (possibly the equivalent of a dog in our world) who is totally lovable and extremely funny."
"Although he isn't really important for the main plot, he would be missed like Scrat would be in Ice Age."
"The really cool thing about Hector is that you need to speak Gibberish to understand him.<br /><br />If the movie is so great, why didn't I give it 10 stars?"
"Well, the plot in itself was rather thin."
"Two hunters are sent out to rescue the world from a really bad dragon who wants to swallow the world, isn't really original."
"That in itself wouldn't be much of a problem."
"What I missed was the background information."
"What kind of a dragon was this and why did it look that way?"
"I love mythical stories but if they get too thin then they seem to be written after the movie is finished in a feeble attempt to give the whole thing some depth.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like was Zo."
"Although a little girl like her could be considered adorable, she was somewhat of a pain in this movie."
"She seemed pretty resistant to all types of learning about reality, kept dreaming of some hero from a story book and basically slowed the others down."
"She would have been OK if she had developed a little more and a little earlier in the movie - or had been less of a girly to start with."
"To me the idea of this girl who was there to twist the story a little backfired on the writers.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really good movie for just about all ages."
"Any one who has seen Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and was bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead."
"Though it wasn't a success in th box office or TV ratings, The Fox Movie Channel still finds a real good motive to show this anually."
"I liked the way that they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in Hebrew.Though Sarandon didn't have long hair like any other Jesus would in other films, his looks are pretty close to what a Jewish man would appear."
"What surprised me or startled me was the scene where Caiaphas told Jesus about Pilate ""And don't ever forget, that you are a Jew!"""
"Though that may have not been a racist remark,Colin Blakely was trying to make Chris Sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men of those days.Keith Michell's portrayal of Pilate was hulking, comparing with his previous performances in ""The Story of Jacob and Joseph"" and ""The Story of David""."
"But if you compare his portrayal of Pilate with Telly Savala's or Hurd Hatfield, you can say that he really painted well the impression of a Roman procurator."
"Okay, note to the people that put together these horror acting legends DVD-collections: I truly am grateful and I hugely support the initiative, but  have you even watched the films before selecting them as part of the collection?"
"When I purchased the Boris Karloff collection there were several films in which the star only played a supportive and unessential role (""Tower of London"", ""The Strange Door"")."
"""The Invisible Ray"", however, is part of the Bela Lugosi collection and here it's actually Boris Karloff who overshadows Bela!"
"This actually would have been a great title for the Boris Karloff collection instead!"
"Bela Lugosi's character is quite possibly the most good-natured and earnest one he ever portrayed in his entire career and good old Karloff actually plays the mad and dangerously obsessed scientist here."
"""The Invisible Ray"" features three main chapters."
"The first one, set in Dr. Janos Rukh's Carpathian castle is pretty boring and demands quite a lot of the viewer's patience, but of course the character drawings and the subject matter discussed here are fundamental for the rest of the film."
"Dr. Rukh (Karloff) demonstrates to a couple of eminent colleagues (among them Bela Lugosi as Dr. Benet) how he managed to capture extraterrestrial rays inside a self-manufactured device."
"The scientists are sincerely impressed with his work and invite Rukh and his lovely wife Diane along for an expedition in the heart of Africa."
"There Dr. Rukh isolates himself from the group, discovers the essential element ""Radium X"" to complete his medical ray and goes completely bonkers after being overexposed to the meteorite himself."
"The third and final act is obviously the best and most horrific one, as it revolves on a good old fashioned killing spree with ingenious gimmicks (melting statues) and a surprising climax."
"Karloff glows in the dark and, convinced the others are out to steal his discovery and even his life, he intends to eliminate them using his deadly touch."
"The narrative structure of ""The Invisible Ray"" sounds rather complicated, but the film is easy to follow and entertaining."
"The story is rather far-fetched but nevertheless compelling and director Lambert Hillyer provides several moments of sheer suspense."
"Boris Karloff is truly fantastic and so is Lugosi, even though he deserved to have a little more screen time."
"Their scenes together are the highlights of the film, along with the funky images of the glowing Boris."
"This movie is essentially shot on a hand held camera by the actors in it."
"In some ways a mockumentary in other ways a video diary from killers it is full on account of a ""Columbine"" style attack."
"While this movie does not answer all the big questions, it does give you an insight into how easy it would be to get away with."
"Through the movie you are shown how the actors illegally shortened shot guns, made pipe bombs and came up with an action plan for ""Zero Day""."
"The actors (if you can call them that) were brilliant, they obviously borrowed heavily from there own lives, but at no stage did I detect them really acting (Something Tom Cruise should try)."
"The use of the CCTV and the 911 operator at the end was genius, but I'm not sure if we needed the very last scene."
"Overall though a really good movie on a very tough topic."
"At least something good came out of Damon Runyon's misguided attempt to sentimentalize the Mafia."
"""Guys and Dolls,"" the seemingly indestructible stage musical, was captured on film in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz (""All About Eve"") in a colorful, enjoyable movie that featured an all-star cast including Vivian Blaine (from the original Broadway show), Jean Simmons (whose character bears an odd resemblance to Audrey Hepburn in ""Roman Holiday"") and two of the all-time great leading men, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both of whom had recently won Oscars for Best Supporting Actor (""From Here To Eternity"") and Best Actor (""On the Waterfront"") and were on the top of their game."
"One listen to Brando singing ""Luck Be a Lady Tonight"" speaks volumes about where the early Dylan got his voice."
"Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson, who brings down the house with ""Sit Down You're Rocking The Boat."""
"The ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard adds yet another page to his rogue's gallery of screen gangsters."
"The film has a bright, cartoonish look, anticipating the Pop Art of the early 1960s."
"The characters speak in a stylized patois, apparently based on Yiddish idioms."
"Although the film's social attitudes and gender roles are dated, it's all great fun, and even the gentle kidding of the Salvation Army is harmless and reflects no real animosity toward organized religion."
"Just seeing Sinatra and Brando in the same film is reason enough to watch this movie, but it has lots of other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes."
"Since Siskel's death and Ebert's absence the show has been left in the incapable hands of Richard Roeper."
"Roeper is not a film critic he just criticizes anything he doesn't like personally i.e."
"films with country music get panned because ""I don't like country music!"""
"and children's movies get a standard ""Don't see it now, wait until it comes out on DVD and rent it for your kids!"""
"Roeper may well be an idiot savant, but in some other field."
"The weekly guests 'sitting-in' for Ebert fare better, but who wants to pick a daisy in the midst of a cow pat?"
"All that said, it IS the only show in town and that alone makes it worth watching."
"As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can talk, so can you!"
"It's your mind and thoughts we long for."
"Do whatever is necessary to get that usurper off his self-declared throne."
"Although Kris Kristofferson is good in this role, who wouldn't want to see Elvis Pressly instead?"
"With the drug addiction and the fall from supreme fame may have scared away Elvis' agent to be apart of the movie, it was a mistake."
"This would have been a perfect movie for Elvis."
"Even though the soundtrack is far from terrific, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand do a decent job in creating an original soundtrack for this ""period"" piece / musical."
"Somewhat of a love story, this is more of a drama about the fall from grace and the gift of redemption."
"Like is most tragedies, the hero of the story was die."
"Also, Gary Busey is once again perfect in a not so perfect role."
"Though it had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in Austin (SXSW Film) just as we were getting tired of things like Shakespeare in Love, and Elizabeth, this movie deserves an audience."
"An inside look at the staging of ""The Scottish Play"" as actors call ""Macbeth"" when producing it to avoid the curse, this is a crisp, efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery which befalls the troupe."
"With a wonderfully evocative score, and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest, this is a quiet gem, not world-class, but totally satisfying."
"This is the French and Belgians doing what they do best."
"It's quirky, visually inventive, exhilarating and emotionally challenging storytelling."
"Director Jaco van Dormael takes us into the world of Georges, a Down's Syndrome sufferer and his quest for a meaningful relationship with someone, just anyone."
"This is not done in a patronising way but with a great sense of fun and also honesty."
"Georges' interplay with corporate management guru, Harry is dazzlingly handled - shifting from comedy to tragedy back to comedy again with breathtaking ease.<br /><br />The Eighth Day puts similar Hollywood fare like Barry Levinson's Oscar winning Rain Man or Robert Zemeckis's Forrest Gump well and truly in the shade."
"At times, it evokes the humour of Milos Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with shades of Dennis Potter thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />As the emotionally blunted and desperately lonely yuppie, Harry, Daniel Auteuil turns in yet another sublime performance."
"But it is matched by the brilliant Pascal Duquenne as Georges."
"It's a movie with uniformly strong performances and so many, memorable set pieces - the shoe shop scene, car showroom scene, George's dance to Genesis's 'Jesus He Knows Me,' the conference scene, the fireworks scene."
"If you haven't seen it, there's only one thing to do."
"Just rent it or attend a screening at a retro cinema near you and see what you've been missing."
"Better still, buy this movie."
"Sheer genius....."
"""Footlight Parade"" is fascinating on so many levels."
"There is no way the supposedly staged ""theater prologues"" could have been produced in any theater on earth, of course."
"Think of the huge pools and three-story tall fountains for ""By A Waterfall,"" for instance."
"(Berkeley directed John Garfield in ""They Made Me a Criminal"" six years later and had the Dead End Kids singing ""By a Waterfall"" as they took their showers.)"
"<br /><br />""Shanghai Lil"" is the best production number in the picture."
"It's a catalog of '30s Warner Bros. sensibilities."
"Note the African guys mixed into the scene with white and Asian prostitutes."
"You would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house."
"Here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others."
"I also get a thrill when the military dancers do a ""card section"" presentation of Roosevelt's image."
"There's also the NRA eagle--the logo of the controversial National Recovery Administration of the New Deal."
"FDR was the new president and hopes were so high that he'd pull the nation out of the Depression."
"You'd never see something so working class oriented coming out of MGM, of course."
"Warner Bros. wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the F.D.R."
"administration."
"<br /><br />Dear little Miss Ruby Keeler was never better than she is playing the Chinese hooker, ""Lil."""
"She hardly even watches her feet as she dances, which was one of her signature flaws."
"<br /><br />The Pre-Code stuff is fun."
"The ""By a Waterfall"" number is wonderful in that regard."
"The girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through Times Square with all its lights on."
"The spread-eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for 35 years."
"In a few months the Production Code would eliminate such naughty pleasures."
"""Let's Bowl"" started out on local television in the Twin Cities."
"It came on late at night, something you'd stumble across while channel surfing after your 7th bottle of Hamm's.<br /><br />Even the ads were locally produced, featuring Wally outside Grumpy's Bar, holding a microphone and stammering nervously -- ""Ahh...over to you, Steve Sedahl."""
"Not sure why, but that one always made me laugh.<br /><br />There was a bowling contest featured under the guise of settling a dispute between two bowlers, but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips."
"Sedahl played it straight, counter-balanced by Rich Kronfeld's bizarre and hilarious ""Wally Hotvedt."""
"Highlights included segments like ""How to Properly Dispose of an Old Bowling Ball"" (chuck them into a lake) and ""Tips on Dating,"" where the duo ""date"" a couple of hookers and Wally ends with the bitter complaint, ""I could have done that myself!"""
"<br /><br />Another segment -- what the duo did on their days off -- featured Steve in beer can strewn hovel, pigging out from the fridge while Wally struggled to climb the cliffs at Taylor's Falls, dressed in his tight pale blue blazer and over-sized headphones."
"Hilarious!"
"<br /><br />Wally's awestruck comments about ""league bowlers,"" and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also highlights.<br /><br />""Let's Bowl"" was picked up by Comedy Central and had some good moments, but the network never really knew what to do with it, running it during prime time and emphasizing the bowling ""competition,"" which was never the point of the show."
"The constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters (Ernie, the Pig, Butch, etc.)"
"were more distractions than anything else."
"The whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced."
"Even Jon Stewart dissed Let's Bowl on the Daily Show -- (not enough lame, snide jokes?)"
"-- an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved far better.<br /><br />How often does a ""Let's Bowl"" come along in the world of modern television, a locally flavored mix of comedic genius and total crap?"
"The networks have the ""total crap"" part down cold, but it's a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark, strange, funny little gem like ""Let's Bowl."""
"<br /><br />Here's hoping they'll put it out on DVD."
"I was really stunned how much a film, that's over 60 years old could impress me."
"It is nearly two hours long, there are absolutely no stars in it, there are subtitles but nevertheless it is interesting and exciting to watch."
"What impressed me mostly was the realism of the film."
"You could nearly feel the coldness of the ice, because you could see that the storms are real."
"This is a relief in a CGI-world like ourdays."
"I wondered how much work this must have been for van Dyke."
"I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it."
"Now who wants to talk about 'Titanic' anymore?"
"It's a great film with a great message and I would recommend it to future directors to see how great and realistic movies can be if they are only directed with realism instead of visual effects."
"This film is an absolute classic for camp."
"That is why it was an Elvira and MST3000 classic."
"Everyone knows the story."
"Scientist keeps his girlfriend's head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local chicks."
"Finally he finds a real hourglass body with a scar-faced chick's head on top."
"The severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off the assistant's remaining ""good"" arm (his other is not right from a scientist's earlier failure), and the whole place burns down.<br /><br />The movie scared us so much as kids that my friend wouldn't go into his basement for a year after seeing it."
"As kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four."
"Only one of those scary movies was really any good (the Original ""The Haunting""."
")<br /><br />I had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers."
"Its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies (complete with porno sound track) scares the hell out of innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing."
"I could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while I'd rather go to the Dentist than watch ""Chicago"" again.<br /><br />Seven is the most I can give it, because its entertainment value is mere luck."
"The film , as cinema, is a disaster."
"Conrad Hall went out with a bang."
"The great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this movie before passing on."
"He did himself proud as this is one of the best-looking crime films you'll ever see.<br /><br />Of course, the acting ain't bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman playing the leads!"
"The amount of action in here is just right, too: not too much; not too little.<br /><br />None of the characters in here, frankly, are ""good guys"" as Hanks is a professional hit-man for town boss Newman."
"Hanks' only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him, although he does teach him how to be the getaway man in robberies!"
"Huh?<br /><br />As good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is, the real star of this film is cinematographer Hall, who paints scene after beautiful scene with his lens."
"His work is just awesome."
"This 1934 adaptation of Somerset Maugham's novel put Bette Davis on the map as a movie actress."
"She might have won an Academy Award for her performance but the films was made on loan, so her studio didn't push for her."
"Her acting in this one doesn't come off well by today's standards."
"As the heartless waitress who jerks Philip, a sensitive medical student, around and nearly ruins his life, Davis is way too shrill, almost demonic."
"Director John Cromwell, who usually elicited good performances from his actresses, was perhaps overwhelmed by this one."
"Davis is watchable, for sure, but so strident and predatory as to seem scarcely human."
"I imagine the character of Millie as quieter, less feminine than Davis, with maybe a touch of the tomboy."
"Davis is such a strong, immediate presence that's there's no air of mystery to her, which makes Philip's attraction to her seem more overtly masochistic than it should be.<br /><br />As Philip, Leslie Howard is excellent."
"His wan, somewhat wilted good looks are perfect for this failed aesthete."
"Nor does he impose a personal interpretation on the part, as, say, Dirk Bogarde might have done, which gives his work a rare clarity."
"He seems completely in control here, as he should be, playing a man with a rational intellect who is in the grip of irrational emotions he cannot manage or even fully satisfy, as the object of his affections moves him in ways he cannot understand."
"Howard was a fine actor, too often cast in standard romantic parts which compelled him to fall back on charm, which he doesn't use here.<br /><br />It's been so long since I've read the book I don't feel comfortable commenting on the movie's faithfulness to it."
"I think it captures the spirit of the story well enough, and that it has in Howard a perfect Philip Carey."
"The sexual undercurrents are muted, and at times Philip behaves so masochistically that in the absence of strong sex feelings makes one wonder about the character's sanity, surely not Mr. Maugham's intention."
"Thanks to Howard's performance, Philip remains firmly in focus, as one can see in his various responses to and yearnings for Millie the extremes to which a reasonable intellect will go to understand the irrational, in himself and in others."
"<br /><br />Overall, a very good film, a little stilted at times, due to its age, it evokes London nicely, and is well acted for the most part."
"I was also on hand for the premiere in Toronto."
"This film was sort of a consolation when I thought I wouldn't be able to get in to see my first choice."
"Well, I was totally blown away."
"By the time I got to the theater I could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie (yes, I actually forgot who was even in it.)"
"Terrific performances from the entire cast."
"Carrie-Anne Moss was great in a true departure from her days as Trinity."
"As for Billy Connolly, I think not since Chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what-so-ever."
"The kids were also great."
"Definitely check this one out if you get the chance.<br /><br />And, by the way, I got to see my first choice anyway- and this was way better."
"Of course the average ""Sci-Fi"" Battle Star Gallactica fan will hate this."
"That kind of makes me happy."
"I don't like those cheesy sci-fi shows especially Battle-star Gallactica and that is why I like this show.<br /><br />The creators of the show got a lot of heat for making this (the unconventional sci-fi way) and it was worth it."
"I read on Wiki that they wanted to appeal to everybody including women and not just sci-fi nerds.<br /><br />This is probably the most promising show since Lost."
"It has the most interesting, clever, and deepest script of any show in some time and it is truly unique.<br /><br />What I love most about the show is that it kind of plays out like a great Anime!"
"From young teens running around shooting guns, to and extremely well balanced and complex script, to robots it reminds me of something that came from Japan except a little bit better (most Anime is too confusing)."
"This movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel."
"The sets, costumes and the color are just so vivid it is just like stepping into a comic book."
"This is the movie I think of when the Mob is mentioned, the suits, the hats and the attitudes.<br /><br />Hoffman gives comic relief as Mumbles and you can't help but feel sorry for Madonna as she tries, and fails, to win Tracy over."
"This movie contains all the classic mob clichs - burying people in concrete, blowing up peoples cars, tieing up the good guy and attempting to blow up his girlfriends house.<br /><br />This movie is a classic in ever sense of the word, even camera angels cry out comic book."
"Its so great to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how a comic should be made into a movie after seeing such mistakes as Spawn and the Hulk."
"<br /><br />!!"
"!YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"
"!"
"O my gosh... Just give me a minute to breath."
"This movie takes you on an awesome ride and doesn't let you go until the very last blow in your face ending."
"This is the the movie for fans of Stormriders and such."
"Legend of Zu was beautifully created, although I didn't like a few things, they used alot of stand ins."
"I wanted to see the real person fight but, oh well... a few small let downs,and I didn't really like it a lot until I watched it again, when you understand it more it totally kicks A**!"
"I encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true Asian movie, to see this movie."
"I give this movie one of my highest ratings.Go and see it when it comes out in America!!"
"!"
"Wow."
"I LOVED the whole series, and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly."
"Perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons 4 & 5, while remaining better than anything else on television."
"But 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons."
"<br /><br />6B started with such a sombre mood and Janice's always keen insight into the family angst - that doom-filled line about knowing Tony's penchant for sitting and staring."
"Anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know Tony."
"Melfi's discomfort over the psychiatric study and its references to the sociopath's self-deluding sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series, say, with Tony's panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool and resonates with Phil's ""wave bye-bye"" line to his grandchildren before the coup de grace of the final episode (not to get into Chase's dark humour).<br /><br />I could go on and on, but I'll just add that I thought the final show - starting with the opening strains of Vanilla Fudge to supply the ironic foreshadow (""You Keep Me Hangin' On"") to the terminal moments where Tony fades back into complacency with his family in tow or blasts apart like AJ's SUV or Phil's head were, utterly, utterly PERFECT."
"The best TV ever."
"<br /><br />Pretty good in a dying medium pathologically supplying the ""jack-off fantasies"" AJ derides (and then into which he promptly subsides)."
"A tip of the pork pie to Mr. Chase."
"Unfortunately, this movie never made it to DVD."
"I saw it when it was first released to the theaters in 1983, and then again when the VHS was released in 1992."
"When I recently saw a VHS copy at a flea market, I immediately bought it."
"I was not disappointed."
"First, the obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and a joy to behold."
"But then, the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to reflect on your values and decide what is really important to you."
"The movie is about a lot of things."
"It is about how the World Bank and large corporations exploit and enslave developing countries with their capitalist schemes to force them into a debt that they can never repay."
"It is about how our economic system exploits us by forcing us into debt with credit cards, mortgage, and car payment."
"It is about trying to save an innocence that maybe we have never really had and maybe we cannot really save."
"It is about good and evil and about how hard it is sometimes to tell one from the other."
"It raises a lot of questions but does not give answers."
"I think sometimes this is good."
"For this reason, this is a film really worth saving and seeing."
"For years we've been watching every horror film that comes out, from the dull Hollywood retreads like Saw 2, to awful indie releases that are completely unmatchable... we suffer through all of bad films in hopes of finding little gems like ""Dark Remains"".<br /><br />We managed to catch a screening of this film at Shriekfest 2005."
"The audience loved it and I believe it ended up winning the award for the best film.<br /><br />While it may not have the budget or star power of studio films, it packs a serious punch in the creepy atmosphere and scare category."
"The acting and cinematography are top notch, but it's the direction that makes this film worth the view."
"The story and characters develop at just the right pace to provide some fantastic scares.<br /><br />The editing and visual fx are also top notch."
"And while many horror films don't manage to use music to their benefit, the score for ""Dark Remains"" only adds to it's creepiness.<br /><br />I know the film has shown at a bunch of festivals, but none have been near me, so I can't wait to hear when it'll finally be coming out on DVD."
"Trust me, even if you're sick of the current state of horror films, give this one a try... you won't regret it!"
"The great talents of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressberger are noticeable in their wonderful ""A Matter of Life and Death""."
"It was part of the recent tribute to Mr. Powell that played at the Walter Reade in New York."
"This film, in particular, shows us one of the best British films from that, or any other era.<br /><br />""A Matter of Life and Death"" has a brilliant cinematography by Jack Cardiff, a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera."
"Particularly impressive is the contrast from the monochromatic tones given to the scenes played in heaven, and the colored ones when the action comes back to earth."
"This was quite a coup, and well ahead of its times."
"The black and white sequence that involves the long staircase where Peter and the Conductor are chatting has to be one of the most amazing things on any film.<br /><br />Much has been said in this forum about the film, so our comment will be about the great acting Powell and Pressberger got out of the large, distinguished cast, who responded magnificently to the directors' guidance.<br /><br />David Niven, is Peter, whose aircraft is hit and his best friend dies as a result of it."
"This film marked one of the highlights in Mr. Niven's career."
"He was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie."
"Kim Hunter is surprisingly good as June, the woman who talked to Peter as his plane was falling from the skies."
"As fate would have it, Peter and June fall in love at first sight.<br /><br />Some of the best British film actors grace this film with their presence."
"Robert Coote, is Bob, the man who is admitted to heaven, but he is surprised his friend Peter never made the trip with him."
"An excellent star turn by Marius Goring, who as the Conductor 71 steals the film."
"Mr. Goring, who had worked with the directors, is one of the best things in the movie."
"Also, Roger Livesey, as Dr. Frank Reeves, does one of the best appearances of his career, as well as Raymond Massey, who is seen as Abraham Farlan.<br /><br />""A Matter of Life and Death"" is a timeless film that will always be seen with gratitude toward its creators."
"If you like adult comedy cartoons, like South Park, then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at Bromwell High."
"Keisha, Natella and Latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches, I think Keisha is a good leader."
"There are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school."
"There's the idiotic principal, Mr. Bip, the nervous Maths teacher and many others."
"The cast is also fantastic, Lenny Henry's Gina Yashere, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Pony's Doon Mackichan, Dead Ringers' Mark Perry and Blunder's Nina Conti."
"I didn't know this came from Canada, but it is very good."
"Very good!"
"One of my favourite ""domestic"" movies."
"I don't know if there is any person in our country who hasn't seen this movie!"
"It's funny, and sad at some moments...I don't know how did people around the world (who had opportunity to watch it) accept this movie, because you have to know some moments in our serbian history and character of Serbs in the first half of the 20th century, to be able to understand it!"
"But as I see here, there is somebody from Canada who watched it...and he liked it.<br /><br />I think that I'll try to put all good quotes from the movie on this site, but first to find out how to do that...<br /><br />Cheers."
"This movie (with the alternate title ""Martial Law 3"" for some reason) introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time."
"And it was a great introduction."
"Although I had never heard of him before, he seemed to be an excellent fighter."
"The action scenes in this movie are GREAT!"
"There are lots of them too, by the way."
"The recruit fight at the Peacekeepers HQ is especially good."
"There's just something about one single guy beating the crap out of a bunch of people that's really fun."
"And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the villain."
"Roles like this fits her (but others don't)."
"Matthias Hues also did a good job, as always."
"He's a great fighter and macho-like character, and was a good rival for Wincott in this movie."
"Deliverance is a stunning thriller, every bit as exciting as any good thriller should aspire to be but also stomach-churningly frightening."
"Though it is not a horror movie, it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film."
"The very thought of being a normal red-blooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of civilisation, only to be captured and sodomised by a couple of violent hillbillies, is surely the worst nightmare of 99.9% of the world's population."
"It would have been easy for Deliverance to slip into exploitation territory, but John Boorman has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores, questions and challenges the very meaning of masculinity."
"With so many films, you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the hero's shoes, performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl.... but with Deliverance, you come away praying to God that you'll never have to experience what these four protagonists go through.<br /><br />Four city guys - Ed (Jon Voight), Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Drew (Ronny Cox) and Bobby (Ned Beatty) - head out into the wilderness to spend a few days canoing down a soon-to-be-dammed river."
"The guys are riding the rapids in pairs, and Ed and Bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others so they pull in to the riverside and await their pals in the adjacent woodland."
"Here, they fall foul of two local woodlanders (Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward), who tie Ed to a tree, while one of them strips and rapes Bobby instructing him, perversely, to ""squeal like a pig""."
"Lewis and Drew arrive unseen and Lewis, being a fair archer, kills the rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest."
"Under great emotional stress, the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area."
"But they find the river increasingly dangerous to negotiate as they journey downstream, and the risk to their lives heightens when the surviving hillbilly returns to take shots at them with his rifle from some unseen vantage point in the rocky cliffs beside the river.<br /><br />Deliverance is very powerful as a survival tale, but even more powerful (and disturbing) as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in humiliated tatters."
"Though all the performances are remarkable, one must take particular note of Beatty's efforts in a role that many actors would've turned down."
"The film is very similar thematically to the 1971 film Straw Dogs - both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales, and in both the eventual violent revenge exacted by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction."
"The backdrop of the rugged countryside in Deliverance is beautiful to look at, but it also adds to the tension by placing the four canoeists in a setting where they are at the mercy of the hillbillies and the landscape, with nobody to rely on other than themselves."
"This truly is suspenseful film-making at its finest."
"Now let me tell you about this movie, this movie is MY FAVORITE MOVIE!!!"
"This movie has excellent combat fighting."
"This movie does sound like a silly story line about how Jet Li plays a super hero, like Spider-Man, or etc."
"But once you've seen this movie, you would probably want to see it again and again."
"I rate this movie 10/10."
"If you like cars you will love this film!<br /><br />There are some superb actors in the film, especially Vinnie Jones, with his typical no nonsense attitude and hardcase appearance.The others are not bad either....<br /><br />There are only two slight flaws to this film."
"Firstly, the poor plot, however people don't watch this film for the plot."
"Secondly, the glorification of grand theft auto (car crime)."
"However if people really believe they can steal a Ferrari and get away with it then good look to them, hope you have a good time in jail!<br /><br />When i first read that Nicolas Cage was to act the main role, i first thought ""...sweeet."
""", but then i thought ""...naaaa you suck!"""
"but then finally after watching the film i realised ""...yep he suck's!"
""".Only joking he plays the role very well.<br /><br />I'll end this unusual review by saying ""If the premature demise of a criminal has in some way enlightened the general cinema going audience as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life, and inspired them to change their ways, then this death carries with it an inherent nobility."
"And a supreme glory."
"We should all be so fortunate."
"You can say ""Poor Criminal."""
"I say: ""Poor us."
"""<br /><br />p.s."
"- Angelina Jolie Voight looks quite nice!"
"most of the bad reviews on this website blame ""Hood of the Living Dead"" for one (or more) of the following reasons: 1) it is a low-budget movie with virtually no acting; 2) it was so bad it made me laugh 3) it is something I could do myself."
"I won't even discuss the first point because it is a very subjective matter whether you like low-budget and independent stuff or not."
"I must say, however, that I still fail to understand people renting such a movie as ""Hood of the Living Dead"" and then looking surprised when they realize it is not as polished and cute as a romantic comedy with Lindsay Lohan or Matthew Mc Conaughey."
"As for the second point, I really don't see what's so wrong with laughing."
"I personally like to laugh, and love movies that make me to, be they comedies or horror flicks."
"When in ""Hammerhead"" I saw this girl stepping into a PUDDLE and the shark-man came out of it to eat her, I just cracked up."
"And I was grateful that the director made such a stupid scene and gave me ten seconds of pure fun."
"Honestly, laughing just makes me feel good, while it seems that many people writing reviews see it as a bad bad thing."
"If you only want to feel sad and scared while watching a movie, ""Hood of the Living Dead"" and low-budget flicks are definitely not for you."
"But please don't come and tell us that you find them laughable."
"We already know it."
"This is most probably why we decided to watch the movie in first place."
"However, it is the third point that leaves totally baffled."
"Just several years ago people were lining up out of theaters to see ""Blair Witch Project"", which is a way more rudimentary, boring, plot-less and bad-acted movie than ""Hood of the Living Dead"" (and takes itself way too seriously too)."
"Moreover, half a million people go on YouTube every day to see the short films of ""Lonelygirl15"", which is certainly something everyone with a cute girlfriend, a room and a webcam could do!"
"Not to talk about all of the even more amateurish videos you can find there."
"Why don't people blame those clips for bad acting and non-existing plot?"
"I think it is one of the best things of our times that everyone, with affordable technology and a bunch of friends, can make their own movies and share them with people that have similar interests."
"And I feel a certain admiration for people who spend their weekends with their friends making a honestly bad (yet refreshing) piece of trash like this rather than shopping at the mall or playing video games alone."
"Leave aside your biases and your desire to sound like a smart film critic by attacking b-movies, and you'll see that ""Hood of the Living Dead"" can bring you almost as much fun as it did to its makers!"
"If you have a taste for refreshing and enjoyable home-made horror movies, I recommend ""Zombiez"", ""The Ghosts of Edendale"", ""The Killer Eye"", ""Monster Man"", ""Don't Look in the Basement"", ""The Worst Horror Movie Ever Made"", ""Redneck Zombies"", ""Jesus Christ Vampyre-Slayer"" and ""Habit""."
"Adrian Pasdar is excellent is this film."
"He makes a fascinating woman."
"Alain Chabat claims this movie as his original idea but the theme of reluctant lovers who finally get it together is as old, if not older, than Shakespeare.<br /><br />Chabat is a ""vieux garcon"", happily single and not wanting any member of the opposite sex to disturb his life."
"He has a problem, 5 sisters and a matriarchal mum - the G7 - who decide he should be married."
"Enter the delightful, charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan."
"Charlotte has to pose as Chabat's girlfriend and then simply not turn up on the day of the wedding."
"No more talk of marriage from the G7."
"Of course the best laid plans have a habit of spiralling out of control.<br /><br />There are very strong supporting roles from Lafont as the mother and Osterman as the tight-fisted brother of Gainsbourg.<br /><br />There are some fantastic scenes as first Charlotte has to charm, then revolt the family."
"French farce with an English."
"As this movie is completely in Swiss dialect, it's probably hard for most German speakers to really follow this movie."
"I'm not from Switzerland, but I worked there for some years, so I had the chance to understand this great spoof of the Lord of the Rings."
"I've seen a lot of movies of this kind (eg."
"Scary Movie, loads of Scifi spoofs etc.)"
"but this one is the best one of that kind, I've seen so far."
"I give a 9 of 10."
"The only reason I can't give a 10 is, because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the DVD, so there's almost no chance for non-Swiss to understand."
"In today's world of digital fabrication, there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer."
"Alas, this type of ""character driven"" film is far too rare these days."
"Duvall's performance as well as James Earl Jones are faithful to their audience's high expectations."
"I wonder if this movie was made for TV?"
"It has a ""close-up"" personal quality to the narrative."
"It is an understatement to say that the performances are all Outstanding."
"The only thing that keeps it from being a cinema Masterpiece is the lack of a great Cinematographer, but pretty pictures are not everything."
"How can talent the likes of Jones and Duvall continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the digitizing?"
"""The Plainsman"" represents the directorial prowess of Cecil B. DeMille at its most inaccurate and un-factual."
"It sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, even though in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place."
"Every once in a while DeMille floats dangerously close toward the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship."
"The film is an attempt to buttress Custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends."
"Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty campy relic by today's standards.<br /><br />TRANSFER: Considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately appealing transfer, with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks."
"There's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments."
"All in all, the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road."
"Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract."
"The audio is mono but nicely balanced.<br /><br />EXTRAS: Forget it."
"It's Universal!"
"BOTTOM LINE: As pseudo-history painted on celluloid, this western is compelling and fun."
"Just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate!"
"It ran 8 seasons, but it's first, in early 1959, and it's last, in the autumn of 1965, were shorter than seasons 2-7."
"CBS chief William Paley canceled Rawhide's production after watching the 1st show of season 8, in September, 1965, because he disliked the series without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor, who had departed after season 7."
"The last new episode aired in November, 1965."
"The lone 1966 CBS broadcast, on January 4, 1966, was a rerun."
"<br /><br />I have often wondered why Rawhide didn't switch to color filming for it's last season?"
"Most of the big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965."
"CBS was broadcasting in color that autumn, for many of their sitcoms, but westerns like Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained in black and white."
"Gunsmoke was the last western (and last prime time network series to switch to color) on September 17, 1966, for the episode Snap Decision."
"."
"."
".but it was on a UHF channel and the reception was very fuzzy."
"I'd really like to own the movie since the reason I watched it in the first place is because I am a bus driver and at the time I saw this movie, I was driving that model bus."
"It was only (during his murder trial some 15 years later) that I remember vaguely that OJ was one of the stars in it."
"I only recall that he was the driver and of the bus' being shot up and driven wildly."
"I've been looking all over for this movie to no avail, since viewing it in the mid-80s."
"I liked the movie, I don't usually watch thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV guide, and viewing its beginning (although fuzzy) I stayed for the whole thing."
"Way, way back in the 1980s, long before NAFTA was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities, the United States and Japan were at each other's throat in the world manufacturing race."
"Remember sayings like 'Union Yes!,' 'the Japanese are taking this country over,' and 'Americans are lazy?"
"'<br /><br />As the Reagan era winded down and corporations edged towards a global marketplace, director Ron Howard made one of several trips into the comedy genre with his 1986 smash 'Gung Ho,' which drew over $36 million in U.S. box office receipts."
"While in many ways dated, Howard's tongue-in-cheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life today.<br /><br />'Gung Ho' focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), the automakers union rep from Hadleyville, a small, depressed town in the foothills of Pennsylvania."
"Stevenson has been asked to visit the Assan Motor Company in Tokyo (similar to real-life Toyota), which is considering a U.S. operation at the town's empty plant."
"With hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse, Assan decides to move in and Stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly line.<br /><br />The 112 minutes of 'Gung Ho' is a humorous look at these two sides, with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered: on one hand, an American workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism; on the other hand, Japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of self-worth."
"In Stevenson, we find an American working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings."
"With the survival of his workers' jobs and most of Hadleyville on the line, Stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance, although his cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble."
"Besides answering to the heads of Assan, we witness a delicate balancing act between Stevenson and his fellow union members, many of whom he grew up with."
"This includes Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Turturro), and Paul (Clint Howard, Ron's brother).<br /><br />The Japanese cast is headed by Gedde Watanabe, also known for 'Sixteen Candles' and 'Volunteers.'"
"Watanabe plays Kazihiro, the plant manager who is down on his luck and begins to feel a sympathy for American life."
"He is constantly shadowed by Saito (Sab Shimono), the nephew of Assan's CEO who is desperate to take his spot in the pecking order."
"While given a light touch, these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the Japanese working culture.<br /><br />With Hunt Stevenson dominating the script, Michael Keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work."
"'Gung Ho' is indeed a slam-dunk success for Keaton, who also teamed with Ron Howard in 1994's 'The Paper.'"
"He made this film during a string of lighter roles that included 'Mr."
"Mom,' 'Beetle Juice,' and 'The Dream Team' before venturing into 'Batman,' 'One Good Cop,' and 'My Life.'"
"It's also hard not to like Gedde Watanabe's performance as the odd man out, who first wears Japanese ribbons of shame before teaming up with Stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unit.<br /><br />The supporting cast is top-notch, including Wendt, Turturro, Shimono, and Soh Yamamura as Assan CEO Sakamoto."
"Mimi Rogers supplies a romantic interest as Audrey, Hunt's girlfriend."
"Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz, and Babaloo Mandel teamed up for Gung Ho's solid writing."
"The incidental music, which received a BMI Film Music Award, was composed by Thomas Newman."
"Gung Ho's soundtrack songs are wall-to-wall 80s, including 'Don't Get Me Wrong,' 'Tuff Enuff,' and 'Working Class Man."
"'<br /><br />The success of 'Gung Ho' actually led to a short-lived TV series on ABC."
